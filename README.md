    Project Setup Instructions

Overview
This project allows you to set up a full-stack application with a React/Vite frontend and Node/Express backend. The backend is connected to a MongoDB database where you can store and retrieve records. You can create and view data using a simple UI created with React, and the data is stored in MongoDB.

Features
- Frontend: Built using React/Vite for a fast and modern user experience.
- Backend: Created with Express.js and MongoDB to handle data and provide REST API endpoints.
- MongoDB: Used to store and retrieve records (name and age).
- CORS enabled: For communication between frontend (localhost:5173) and backend (localhost:5000).

How to Set Up

1. Clone the Project
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>

2. Set Up Frontend (React/Vite)
After cloning the project, follow these steps to set up the frontend:

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
cd frontend

2. Install dependencies:
npm install

3. Start the development server:
npm run dev

4. Access the frontend by opening your browser and going to http://localhost:5173.

3. Set Up Backend (Express and MongoDB)
To set up the backend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
cd backend

2. Install dependencies:
npm install

3. Start the backend server:
npm start

4. The backend server will be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

4. MongoDB Setup
Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your local machine. The backend will try to connect to mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mydb.

If you donâ€™t have MongoDB installed, follow the instructions from the official website:
- Install MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)

5. Usage
- The frontend application will show a list of records fetched from MongoDB.
- You can add new records (name and age) using the form in the UI, and they will be saved to the database.
- After adding a record, the UI will update automatically with the new data.

6. Available Options
When creating the project, you can choose from the following options:
- Frontend: Only the frontend folder will be created, and you can set up a React application.
- Backend: Only the backend folder will be created, with Express and MongoDB setup.
- Fullstack: Both frontend and backend will be created, allowing you to have a complete full-stack application.

7. Why This Project Was Created
This project is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly set up a full-stack application with a modern React frontend and a robust Node/Express backend. The goal is to provide a simple structure where you can:
- View and interact with data stored in MongoDB.
- Learn how to connect a React frontend with a Node/Express backend.
- Understand basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a MongoDB database.

8. Notes
- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- MongoDB should be running locally on your machine.
- If you face any CORS-related issues, make sure CORS is handled in your backend.
